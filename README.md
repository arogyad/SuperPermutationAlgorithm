# SuperPermutationAlgorithm

I came up with this algorithm while looking at the super permutation strings. I don't know if this algorithm has been implemented before, and if it has been implemented before please contact me for removal.

It gives correct super permutation string for n≤6 and forms a partial solution for n ≥ 6.
