# SuperPermutationAlgorithm

I came up with this algorithm while looking at the super permutation strings. I don't know if this algorithm has been implemented before, and if it has been implemented before please contact me, and I will remove it.

It gives correct super permutation string for n≤6 and forms a partial solution for n ≥ 6. The values created by this algorithm match with that obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2549"> Aaron Williams'</a> method, but I don't understand a single string of mathematics on the paper. Please let me know if his and my algorithm are the same. You can read more about the algorithm on my blog <a href="arogyad.github.io"> here</a>.
